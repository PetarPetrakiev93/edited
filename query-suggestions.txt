Here are some possible indexes that could improve the performance of this query:

An index on the product_id column in the orders table would allow the query to more efficiently join the orders and products tables.
An index on the customer_id column in the orders table would allow the query to more efficiently join the orders and customers tables.
An index on the customer_id and product_id columns in the orders table would allow the query to more efficiently perform the self-join on the orders table to compute the average number of days between purchases.
These indexes would be particularly useful if the orders table is large, and if there are many distinct values in the product_id and customer_id columns. They would also be useful if the query is run frequently and the performance of the query is critical for the application.
